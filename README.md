## Introduction

[Gimli (pdf)](https://gimli.cr.yp.to/gimli-20170627.pdf) is a a
cross-platform permutation that can be used to implement block ciphers,
tweakable block ciphers, stream ciphers, message-authentication codes,
authenticated ciphers, hash functions, etc.

The term cross-platform means that Gimli is designed for energy efficient
hardware implementations as well as efficient SW
implementation in anything microcontrollers to high performance CPY.
Gimli is efficient for short as well as long messages.
